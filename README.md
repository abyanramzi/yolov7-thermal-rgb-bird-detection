## üìå Overview

This research explores **real-time detection of birds in cages**, focusing on both the **number of birds** and their **species identification**.  
We adopt **YOLOv7**, a state-of-the-art real-time object detection framework, to perform detection under different imaging modalities.  

Two types of cameras are employed for image acquisition:
- **RGB Camera** ‚Äî captures standard visual images.
- **Thermal Camera** ‚Äî provides infrared imaging for detection in challenging lighting conditions.  

To assess performance, we introduce a **cage contour measurement technique**, which classifies cages based on the percentage of obstacles (from least to most obstructed).  
The performance of the detection model is then compared across both camera types under varying cage conditions.

## üó∫Ô∏è System Topology and Illustration

### Topology
The topology below illustrates the overall data flow and system components.

![System Topology](paper/figures/topology.jpg)  
*Figure 1. Proposed system topology for bird detection.*

This system is composed of the following components:
- **Camera Nodes** ‚Äî RGB and Thermal cameras, wired to Raspberry Pi 4.  
- **Edge Device** ‚Äî Raspberry Pi 4 handles initial preprocessing.  
- **Router** ‚Äî Provides Wi-Fi connectivity to the cloud server.  
- **Cloud Server** ‚Äî Executes YOLOv7 detection and classification.  
- **Dashboard** ‚Äî Displays results returned to Raspberry Pi 4.  

**Workflow:**
1. RGB and Thermal cameras capture bird images inside the cage.  
2. Raspberry Pi 4 performs image preprocessing.  
3. Preprocessed data is transmitted to the cloud server via Wi-Fi.  
4. Cloud server runs YOLOv7 detection and species classification.  
5. Results are returned and displayed on the dashboard.

## üìê Cage Contour Measurement

The cage contour measurement estimates how much of the cage view is obstructed by cage bars or covers.  
This ratio is later used to analyze how obstacle levels affect detection performance.

### üîé Pseudocode

#### Step 1: Read Input Image
image ‚Üê READ_IMAGE(image_path)

#### Step 2: Convert to Grayscale
gray_image ‚Üê CONVERT_TO_GRAYSCALE(image)

#### Step 3: Apply Binary Thresholding
binary_image ‚Üê APPLY_BINARY_THRESHOLD(gray_image)

#### Step 4: Count Pixels
total_pixels ‚Üê COUNT_TOTAL_PIXELS(binary_image)
black_pixels ‚Üê COUNT_PIXELS(binary_image, value = BLACK)
white_pixels ‚Üê COUNT_PIXELS(binary_image, value = WHITE)

#### Step 5: Calculate Ratios
black_ratio ‚Üê black_pixels / total_pixels
white_ratio ‚Üê white_pixels / total_pixels

#### Step 6: Return Results
RETURN black_ratio, white_ratio

## üìà Evaluation

We evaluate the model performance using a **confusion matrix**.
